Goals
-----

Move Stitch!
  - keyboard input
    - some googling of java keyboard input
    - some design
  - response, basically as fast as possible
    - run separately from main thread
  - obey all the standard
    - this is already implemented (just reuse all current movement logic)
  
Keyboard input
--------------
response?
  - polling
    - check if key is pressed
    - do something
    - usually rate based   
        - every 20ms check if key was pressed
    - to be useful typically on separate thread
  - event based
    - somethings given an event
    - if key is pressed do something
    - slightly delayed
    
  - Direct Memory Access (typical)
    - puts information in a buffer in Memory
    - notifies OS
    - and process reads the Memory
      - this means proccess still has control over its runtime
