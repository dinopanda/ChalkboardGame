Rename BoardLayoutParser
  - to parse 
  - as well as add to main.com.dino.board/main.com.dino.grid

  Pros
  - a little more simple
  Cons
  - expanded reach/ability object

Return an object to be used by someone else
  - return list of objects to be made
  - caller will add list of objects to main.com.dino.grid

  Pros
  - follows original naming
  - object logic is simple
  Cons
  - memory footprint could be large 
    - but this is only at init time and would get clean up

To do:
    - create the correct objects for the list
    X we need a list
    X update methods to handle returned list
